## OpenTelemetry Collector [#collector]

The OpenTelemetry [collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) is a configurable and extensible software component to recieve, process, and export telemetry data. It often plays an important role in OpenTelemetry environments, where it can operate in multiple capacities: As a gateway, the collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. As an agent, the collector is deployed on each host in an environment, and collects telemetry data about the host and potentially processes running on it. Some environments may chain agent collectors with gateway collectors.

### New Relic Exporter [#newrelic-exporter]

The [collector repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) contains core collector code. An additional [collector contrib repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) contains extensions not part of the core distribution. 

One of these extensions is the [New Relic Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/newrelicexporter), which allows trace, metric, and log data flowing through the collector to be exported to New Relic. Using the collector with the New Relic Exporter is the current recommended approach for ingesting OpenTelemetry data into New Relic. 

The general strategy is to have applications export telemetry data to a collector via [OTLP](#otlp) (or some other mechanism), which is subsequently exported to New Relic. 

The [OpenTelemetry Collector with New Relic Exporter](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/collector/nr-exporter-docker) example demonstrates what such a setup might look like.

## OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) [#otlp]

[OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md), or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project, which describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data. 

Each language implementation supports exporting via OTLP by default, and the collector contains both an [OTLP receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/receiver/otlpreceiver) and an [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlpexporter). This makes it a natural choice as a transport for OpenTelemetry data.

#### Native OTLP Endpoint (pre-release) [#native-otlp]

New Relic has native OTLP support currently in pre-release. This allows applications to bypass a collector and export telemetry data directly to New Relic. For a number of reasons, some may still be interested in using the collector in their environment. The native OTLP endpoint is still useful in this scenario as it allows collector configurations to use the [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlpexporter) instead of the [New Relic Exporter](#newrelic-exporter).

If you are interested in the pre-release program, let us know by completing this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIJVEAYaP7TXe9LmQA64yIObGvt-nOiz5kXYsjxLBbvut_1A/viewform).

## Language Exporters

New Relic has published a series of language specific exporters. These allow applications to export OpenTelemetry data directly to New Relic without a [collector](#collector). The [native OTLP endpoint](#native-otlp) makes this strategy obsolete since it allows applications to export data directly to New Relic without any additional dependencies using the built in OTLP exporter.

The exporters and their maintenance status are as follows:

- [Go](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go) - To Be Archived Soon
- [Java](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-java) - Archived
- [Python](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-python) - Archived 
- [.NET](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-dotnet/tree/main/src/NewRelic.OpenTelemetry) - To Be Archived Soon

### Advanced Endpoint Configuration

If using a language exporter, in some cases you may need to change the default endpoint settings. By default, New Relic OpenTelemetry exporters send data to these US data centers:

* Spans: [https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1](https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1)
* Metrics: [https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1](https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1)

If you need to send data to the EU region, use the following endpoints:

<Callout variant="tip">
  These URLs don't apply to Infinite Tracing
</Callout>

* Spans: [https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1](https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1)
* Metrics: [https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1](https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1)

If you are setting up Infinite Tracing:

1. Replace the default span endpoint with the New Relic trace observer. Follow the steps in [Set up the trace observer](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/set-trace-observer) to get the value for <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>. Configure your integration to use the value of <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var> in place of the default span endpoint.
2. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that your OpenTelemetry integrations use the `AlwaysOn` sampler.
